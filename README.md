# DefensePro-Sync

Sync DefensePro Configuration & Baselines.

## Installation

Download the release version of this project and upload to vDirect.

# Important Notes
Sync may take couple of min, during that time DP may terminate the connection, it is good practice to set the below 
values (value may change upon the amount of policies needed to be sync):
    
    - manage telnet session-timeout set 35
    - manage ssh session-timeout set 35

In the event of large number of policies, you may need to set to true the "Update Policies for each import operation" boolean.

## Supported Features

	- Network Policy with all its dependencies.
	- Server Policy with all its dependencies.
	- HTTPs Flood Protection
	- SSL Protected Objects
	- SSL Certificates\Keys
	- Network classes
	- Black \ White Lists
	- Packet anamoly settings

## Prerequisite & Limitations

1. Radware recommends using SNMPv3 once registering the devices in Vision.
2. If the max number of policies (Tunning values) is different between the devices the script will halt (versions 6 & 7).
3. All devices version must match.
4. Current number of Network \ Server policies should not reach the max values (1 less than the max number in tunning values).
5. Script should be run once \ twice a day (baselines are not updated that frequently).
6. Minimum of 30 min should be left between each run(regardless which device).

## General Information

1. the script takes as input minimum of two devices, one source device (Master) and array of destination devices.
2. During synchronization NO configuration changes are allowed.
3. The script goes ahead and apply all configuration changes.
4. No rollback option is available, set device backup schedule task on Vision server.
5. Max duration for the Script should take not more than 10 min.

## How to install

1. Upload the zip file as is to vDirect workflow template (Inventory->workflow template).
2. create a workflow instance from the workflow template.
3. From this point forward you can re-use the workflow instance for each sync operation.
4. Under the workflow instance (operations->workflows) you should have two options; 'Sync Action', 'Test Email'.
5. For scheduled job (operations-> scheduled job)
